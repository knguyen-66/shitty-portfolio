# shitty-portfolio

As the name suggest.

A place to:

- Show people that I have a portfolio
- Document & link my projects (also want to improve my grammar on writing long English articles)
- Other types of showcase (goodbye Instagram, my images gonna be here)

Stack: Golang, HTMX, Templ, TailwindCSS
